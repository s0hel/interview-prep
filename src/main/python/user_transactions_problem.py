# Problem Statement
# ----
# You are given a large dataset of user transactions, where each transaction is represented
# by a timestamp and an amount. Write a function to determine the total transaction amount
# for each day, and identify the day with the highest total transaction amount.
#
# Requirements
# ----
# Write a function that processes the dataset and returns the day with the highest transaction total.
#
# - Optimize your solution for performance, considering that the dataset may be very large.
# - Discuss time and space complexity of your solution.
# - Consider edge cases and possible pitfalls.


def find_day_with_highest_total(transactions):
    pass


# Example usage
transactions = [
    ("2024-08-01", 100),
    ("2024-08-01", 150),
    ("2024-08-01", 100),
    ("2024-08-02", 200),
    ("2024-08-02", 50),
    ("2024-08-03", 300)
]

print(find_day_with_highest_total(transactions))  # Output: "2024-08-01"
